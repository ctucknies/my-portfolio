    "about": "Hello! I am Connor Tucknies :) \n\n\nI am a Senior Quality Engineer, SDET, and Scrum Master with a passion for software development. My journey in the world of technology has been an exciting one, as I constantly aspire to evolve as a developer. Beyond my professional pursuits, I'm deeply passionate about music, with a particular love for rap, hip-hop, and house music. When I'm not immersed in code, you can find me enjoying quality time with my beloved cat, exploring the virtual realms of video games, staying active in sports, or satisfying my wanderlust through travel adventures. Through this portfolio, I invite you to explore my diverse interests and the skills I've cultivated on my ever-evolving tech journey",
